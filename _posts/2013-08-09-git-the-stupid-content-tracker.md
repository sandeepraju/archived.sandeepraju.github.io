Recently, I gave a talk at [PES Institute of Technology](http://pesit.pes.edu) on [Git](http://git-scm.com/) as a part of _Saturday Morning Tech_ (An initiative by [PES OpenSource Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pesosc/)). It was fun talking about technology after a long time in college :)
