It's been almost an year already (well, [342 days to be exact](https://ideone.com/EynuKF)) since I wrote anything here. A lot of it had to do with laziness and procastination rather than being busy and all that ;)

But then, in life, you make this constant effort to improve - "be the better you". Being on such a journey of late, I have started to get back to writing.

As always, no promises on being regular but I'll be writing more, and on a lot more diverse topics that I used to! But, before all that; what was I upto all this while? I have a lot to say about it, but then I thought why bore people to death with it and came up with this tiny list:

* __[Talk at PyCon India 2014](https://in.pycon.org/funnel/2014/245-sharq-an-api-queueing-system-built-at-plivo/)__ - Yeah, this was long due and it was fun presenting my work to a bunch of geeks.
* __[Release of SHARQ](https://github.com/plivo/sharq-server)__ - A long time dream to author and open source project finally came true.
* __[The himalayan winter trek with friends](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vijeshm/albums/72157649645068230)__ - Yet another fun trip with the [Sanchaara team](https://sancharaa.wordpress.com/about/).
* __Meeting [Dave Cheney](https://twitter.com/davecheney), [William Kennedy](https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet)__ and [BG](https://twitter.com/ghoseb) at [GopherCon India](http://www.gophercon.in/2015/) - Some raw inspiration interacting with them.
* __Building _yn (wine)_ with [SK](https://twitter.com/srikrishnaholla) at [AngelHack 2015](http://angelhack.com/hackathon/bangalore-2015/)__ - Thought the hack finally didn't see the light of the day, it was awesome fun as ususal working with Shrikrishna after a long time.
* __Mentoring Interns at [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/)__ - Great fun interacting and mentoring the interns. Learnt a lot in the process which will help me in the days to come.
* __Quitting my first job at [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/)__ - It's hard to leave what you love the most, but then life had more interesting adventures up its sleeve.
* __Building [Strawberry Stack](https://github.com/sandeepraju/strawberry) with team Lambda at [Sequoia Hack 2015](http://www.sequoiahack.com/)__ - As always, it is fun hacking with [SK](https://twitter.com/srikrishnaholla), [P G](https://twitter.com/phalgun_g) and [Sujay](https://twitter.com/SujaySKumar1412).
* __Getting into [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu/)__ - Here I am, right now, at the start of my next adventure in this journey!

It has been great so far (of course with a fair mix of ups and downs) and I am really excited to see what lies ahead for me.
