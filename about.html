<p>Hi, I'm Sandeep, working as an Engineer at <a href="https://www.salesforceiq.com">SalesforceIQ</a> after graduating from Northwestern University with a Masters degree in Computer Science. </p>

<p>I love talking to computers and meeting new people. Programmer at heart, you can find me often coding up something sitting in a cozy coffee shop or an empty computer lab ;)</p>

<p>Orignially from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qbTS2iRbuGB2">Bangalore, India</a>; currently I live in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4ZqSoGdoLzs">'Bay Area'</a> region (a.k.a The Silicon Valley)</p>

<p>I'm always up for a quick chat over coffee on any topic from code to contemporary art. Feel free to tweet at me <a href="https://www.twitter.com/sandeeprajup">@sandeeprajup</a></p>

<p>Or, if you prefer the good old email; write to me at <strong>me[AT]sandeepraju[DOT]in</strong></p>

<p>I'm on <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/sandeeprajup">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sandeepraju/">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sandeep.raju.p">Facebook</a> as well.</p>

<!-- <p>I am actively looking for full-time opportunities Starting January 2017. You can find my <a href="/assets/SandeepRajuPrabhakar-CV.pdf">CV here</a>.</p> -->
