<p>Hi, I'm Sandeep, CS Grad student at Northwestern University. I love talking to computers and meeting new people. Programmer at heart, you can find me often coding up something sitting in a cozy coffee shop or an empty computer lab ;)</p>

<p>Hailing from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qbTS2iRbuGB2">Bangalore, India</a>; currently I live in the lovely city of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cNqLRkpyVsH2">Evanston, IL</a></p>

<p>At Northwestern, I am learning to make computers smarter using Machine Learning and Neural Networks.</p>

<p>I'm always up for a quick chat over coffee on any topic from code to contemporary art. Feel free to tweet at me <a href="https://www.twitter.com/sandeeprajup">@sandeeprajup</a></p>

<p>Or, if you prefer the good old email; write to me at <strong>me[AT]sandeepraju[DOT]in</strong></p>

<p>I'm on <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/sandeeprajup">Linkedin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sandeepraju/">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sandeep.raju.p">Facebook</a> as well.</p>

<p>I am actively looking for internship opportunities for the Summer of 2016. You can find my <a href="/assets/SandeepRajuPrabhakar-CV.pdf">CV here</a>.</p>
