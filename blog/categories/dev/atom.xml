    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to my <a href="https://twitter.com/GurteshwarSingh">telephony geek friend</a> for letting me know this simple but highly useful method to selectively dump <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">django</a> models data into a django standard <em>model-dump</em> format. Here is a simple snippet which shows how to selectively dump only the required rows and not the entire model.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>```python
from django.core import serializers</p>

<h1>Generate a queryset depending on whatever you need</h1>

<p>query_set = YourModel.objects.all()[:2000]  # selecting only first 2k rows</p>

<h1>Serialize the queryset into JSON with indentation of 4 spaces</h1>

<p>json_data = serializers.serialize(&ldquo;json&rdquo;, query_set, indent=4)</p>

<h1>Dump the json data into a file</h1>

<p>output_file = open(&lsquo;YourModel.json&rsquo;, &lsquo;w&rsquo;)
output_file.write(json_data)
output_file.close()</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Works like a charm!</p>

<p>Happy coding :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I helped my friend setup <a href="http://vijaym.in">his octopress blog</a>. The problem was that, we were miles apart and interacting via chat turned out to be hard. What we needed was a shared terminal where both of us could see the commands entered by either of us. A quick google search showed me that this was possible easily using <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Simply said, tmux is a <em>terminal multiplexer</em>. What that means? Here is what the <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">official site</a> says&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal. And do a lot more.</p></blockquote>

<p>Basically, its a better alternative to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a> which I was already using for a while.</p>

<p>This is what I did to share <em>his</em> terminal with <em>me</em>,</p>

<ul>
<li>We installed tmux using the command <code>sudo apt-get install tmux</code> on both the systems.</li>
<li>Asked him to run the following commands on the terminal that <em>he</em> wants to share with <em>me</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>```bash</p>

<h1>specify the name of the tmux socket with -S when creating it</h1>

<p>tmux -S /tmp/share</p>

<h1>chmod to allow me to access his socket</h1>

<p>chmod 777 /tmp/share
```</p>

<ul>
<li>Then, I logged into <em>his</em> system via SSH and ran the following command to access the terminal <em>he</em> is sharing with <em>me</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>```bash</p>

<h1>now to connect to his shared terminal</h1>

<p>tmux -S /tmp/share attach
```</p>

<p>As simple as that!</p>

<p>Happy coding :)</p>

    <id>http://sandeepraju.in/blog/2013/08/05/ssh-connection-timeout</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A part of my work involves ssh-ing to multiple servers and working remotely. One of the major problems I faced with this was the frequent ssh timeout and as a result I had to close my hung terminal and re-ssh back. Recently I got fed up of this and found a solution to this problem on <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/98562/way-to-avoid-ssh-connection-timeout-freezing-of-terminal-tab">a superuser thread</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The solution involved configuring ssh on either the client machine or on the server. The basic reason why ssh times out is becasue the ssh server expects a <em>sign-of-life</em> signal from your client at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Add the following configuration on the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file in you client(local) system.</p>

<pre><code>Host remotehost
  HostName remotehost.com
  ServerAliveInterval 60
</code></pre>

<p>this tells ssh to send <em>sign-of-life</em> signal every 60s whenever you are connected to remotehost.com. You can also enable it for all hosts that you connect to by changing the remotehost to * as follows.</p>

<pre><code>Host *
  ServerAliveInterval 60
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Nevertheless, sometimes, due to some network issues the session might hang. In such cases, to end the SSH session, press <code>ENTER ~ .</code> in sequence.</p>

<p>Happy coding! :)</p>
