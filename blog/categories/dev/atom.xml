    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A part of my work involves ssh-ing to multiple servers and working remotely. One of the major problems I faced with this was the frequent ssh timeout and as a result I had to close my hung terminal and re-ssh back. Recently I got fed up of this and found a solution to this problem on <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/98562/way-to-avoid-ssh-connection-timeout-freezing-of-terminal-tab">a superuser thread</a>.</p>

<p>The solution involved configuring ssh on either the client machine or on the server. The basic reason why ssh times out is becasue the ssh server expects a <em>sign-of-life</em> signal from your client at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Add the following configuration on the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file in you client(local) system.</p>

<pre><code>Host remotehost
  HostName remotehost.com
  ServerAliveInterval 60
</code></pre>

<p>this tells ssh to send <em>sign-of-life</em> signal every 60s whenever you are connected to remotehost.com. You can also enable it for all hosts that you connect to by changing the remotehost to * as follows.</p>

<pre><code>Host *
  ServerAliveInterval 60
</code></pre>

<p>Happy coding! :)</p>
