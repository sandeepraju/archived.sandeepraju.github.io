Phew! Finally, a new look to my website! Hoping that this will last for a while without any more problems...  

Ok, so a bit of intro to this site and then a bit on what i'll be doing on this site!

<!-- more -->

This site is powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and hosted on [Github](http://github.com). A few months back I started looking for a simple blogging platform. I started with Vanilla [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), then moved on to [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde) (for my love of python :P) and then finally to Octopress. Octopress is like Jekyll on steroids (at least that's what some of my friends told me ;)). After looking at the ease of setup and fair amount of documentation, I decided that Octopress was the thing to go with. If you are planning to use a static site generator, then I'd highly recommend Octopress.

I'll be writing on this blog almost on a weekly basis. But don't expect neat, tailor cut blog posts here. I'll just be using this space to note down some stuff as I learn new things everyday, so that I know where to search for if I need it anytime in the future :) But there is no harm in checking this space once in a while to discover something new ;)

Thats it for the intro post!

Hello World!

Happy coding :)

PS: I suck at grammar. Please correct me if I am wrong somewhere :)
