### About This Site ###
This website is using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and hosted on [Github](https://www.github.com/). Due to my crunching timeline, I did not find time to design the site myself :|  
Using this amazing theme by [Reza Jatnika](https://github.com/rezajatnika) for the time being.
